# albiononlinedb

To get started:
git clone https://github.com/ToothpickFactory/albiononlinedb.git
cd ./albiononlinedb
npm i

To start just the frontend:
cd src/www
gulp && gulp serve

Right now working on the server will be a bit rough since you will need mongodb installed and dump of the data. I will be working on getting that available.

You can turn on the entire server by running npm start.
